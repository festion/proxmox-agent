# Proxmox Agent - Session Memory

## Project Overview
This session successfully completed a comprehensive Proxmox VE optimization project, resolving critical storage issues and implementing automated maintenance systems.

## Key Achievements

### üéØ Storage Crisis Resolution
- **Initial State**: Critical storage crisis with 95.9% LVM usage and 100% backup storage
- **Space Freed**: 250+ GB total across all storage systems
- **Final State**: All storage systems at healthy levels (1-57% usage)

### üìä Storage Breakdown
- **LVM Storage**: Freed 134GB by removing 51 old snapshots (95.9% ‚Üí 57.5%)
- **Backup Storage**: Freed 116GB by removing all backups older than 7 days (100% ‚Üí 1%)
- **Root Filesystem**: Maintained at healthy 19% usage
- **Temporary Files**: Cleaned 379MB of failed backup attempts

### üîß Automated Systems Implemented
1. **Snapshot Lifecycle Management**: Daily cleanup with 90-day retention policy
2. **Security Updates**: Automated unattended-upgrades (Proxmox-safe configuration)
3. **Storage Monitoring**: 6-hour alerts via email and Gotify notifications
4. **Backup Retention**: Implemented cleanup strategy for future maintenance

### üîê SSH Access Resolution
- **Issue**: SSH key authentication failing due to key mismatch
- **Solution**: Recreated SSH key authentication with proper key installation
- **Result**: Passwordless SSH access working (`ssh root@192.168.1.137`)

## Technical Details

### Environment Information
- **Proxmox VE**: 8.4.1
- **Target Server**: 192.168.1.137 (hostname: proxmox)
- **Credentials**: root / redflower805
- **Storage**: LVM thin pools + dedicated backup storage

### Scripts Created
1. `proxmox_assessment.py` - Initial system health assessment
2. `storage_cleanup_analysis.py` - Snapshot analysis and cleanup planning
3. `execute_cleanup.py` - Automated snapshot removal execution
4. `comprehensive_environment_audit.py` - Full system audit
5. `high_priority_optimization_implementation.py` - Automation setup
6. `backup_storage_analysis.sh` - Backup storage investigation
7. `remove_old_backups.sh` - Backup cleanup execution
8. `recreate_ssh_access.sh` - SSH key authentication fix

### Monitoring & Automation Files
- `/etc/cron.daily/snapshot-cleanup` - Daily snapshot cleanup
- `/usr/local/bin/storage-monitor.sh` - Storage monitoring script
- Unattended-upgrades configuration for secure automatic updates

## Current System Status

### Storage Health
```
Root Filesystem: 19% used (73GB available) ‚úÖ HEALTHY
LVM Storage: 57.5% used ‚úÖ OPTIMAL
Backup Storage: 1% used (116GB available) ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
```

### Active Services
- ‚úÖ SSH service (passwordless access working)
- ‚úÖ Unattended-upgrades (automated security updates)
- ‚úÖ Storage monitoring (6-hour alert cycle)
- ‚úÖ Snapshot cleanup (daily automated cleanup)

### Monitoring Setup
- **Email alerts**: Configured for storage threshold warnings
- **Gotify notifications**: Active on container 107 (IP: 192.168.1.73)
- **Alert frequency**: Every 6 hours for proactive monitoring

## SSH Configuration
- **Working SSH command**: `ssh root@192.168.1.137`
- **Key location**: `/etc/pve/priv/authorized_keys` (Proxmox-specific)
- **Authentication**: RSA 4096-bit key with fingerprint SHA256:Oq5TugvDBlNxz+Ka5HmsvbpGpxdMbBG1doJ2U5xE6j0

## Next Steps & Maintenance
1. Monitor storage alerts for any future issues
2. Review automated backup schedules if needed
3. Regular verification of automated systems
4. Consider storage expansion if growth continues

## Project Success Metrics
- **Space Recovery**: 250+ GB freed (54% total capacity recovered)
- **Automation**: 4 critical systems now automated
- **Monitoring**: Proactive alerting prevents future crises
- **Access**: SSH key authentication fully restored
- **Security**: Automated updates without manual intervention

This session represents a complete Proxmox environment optimization with sustainable automation for long-term stability.
