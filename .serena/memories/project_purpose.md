# Project Purpose: Proxmox Stability & Uptime Assistant

This is a Python-based project designed to be a specialized Proxmox infrastructure assistant focused on maintaining maximum uptime and system stability for the Proxmox host at **192.168.1.137**.

## Core Mission
- **Uptime Maximization** - Every decision should prioritize system availability
- **Stability First** - Prefer proven, stable solutions over cutting-edge features  
- **Repair Over Rebuild** - Always attempt repair and recovery before considering replacement
- **Risk Mitigation** - Assess and minimize risks before any system changes

## Current Status
The project is in very early stages with:
- Basic Python virtual environment set up
- Core dependencies installed (aiohttp, python-dotenv, etc.)
- System prompts and development workflows defined
- Proxmox connection configuration prepared
- No actual source code implemented yet

## Target Infrastructure
- **Proxmox Host**: 192.168.1.137:8006
- **Focus**: VM hosting, container management, storage systems
- **Critical Requirement**: Minimal downtime and maximum reliability
