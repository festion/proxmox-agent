## Troubleshooting Guide

### High Storage Usage (>85%)
1. Run: `pvesm status`
2. Identify critical storage pools
3. Migrate VMs to lower-usage storage
4. Clean old snapshots and backups
5. Review storage allocation policies

### Backup Failures
1. Check: `pvenode task list --type backup`
2. Review backup job configurations
3. Verify target storage accessibility
4. Check available space on backup targets
5. Restart failed backup jobs manually

### NFS Mount Issues
1. Check: `df -h | grep nfs`
2. Test: `ping 192.168.1.98` (NFS server)
3. Remount: `mount -a`
4. Check NFS server logs
5. Verify network connectivity

### System Performance Issues
1. Check: `top`, `iotop`, `htop`
2. Identify high I/O processes
3. Review storage performance
4. Check for hardware issues
5. Consider load balancing

## Emergency Procedures

### CRITICAL Storage (>90%)
**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Stop non-essential VMs
2. Migrate critical VMs to other storage
3. Clean temporary files and logs
4. Expand storage capacity if possible
5. Contact system administrator

### NFS Server Failure
**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Switch backups to local storage
2. Verify VM data integrity
3. Contact NFS server administrator
4. Plan temporary storage allocation
5. Document incident for post-mortem

### Multiple System Failures
**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Escalate to senior administrator
2. Document all error conditions
3. Follow disaster recovery procedures
4. Prioritize critical service restoration
5. Communicate status to stakeholders

## Benefits of Daily Monitoring

- Proactive issue detection before failures
- Systematic approach to storage management
- Consistent monitoring and reporting
- Historical trend analysis
- Automated maintenance scheduling
- Comprehensive audit trail

## Success Metrics

- Zero unplanned storage outages
- <5% of storage pools exceeding 85% capacity
- 100% backup success rate
- <24 hour resolution time for issues
- 99.9% NFS availability

## Customization Notes

- Alert thresholds can be adjusted in each script
- Email notifications require mail server configuration
- Web dashboard can be integrated with monitoring systems
- Scripts can be extended for additional checks
- KPI thresholds should be reviewed quarterly

## Next Steps

1. Configure email notifications for alerts
2. Integrate with external monitoring tools
3. Set up automated storage expansion triggers
4. Implement capacity planning automation
5. Schedule regular review meetings
