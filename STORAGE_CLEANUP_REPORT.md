## 🟡 REVIEW BEFORE DELETING (25 items)

### June 5 Update Snapshots (14 days old)
These are 2 weeks old - **review** if you need them before deletion:

- All containers have `Update_20250605_*` snapshots
- Age: 14 days (medium risk)
- **Recommendation:** Keep for now OR delete if you're confident in current system state

## 🔴 DO NOT DELETE (41 items)

### Active Disk Images (306.18 GB)
These are the actual VM and container root disks - **NEVER DELETE**:
- `vm-100-disk-0` through `vm-126-disk-0` (container root filesystems)
- `vm-114-disk-0` (Home Assistant VM disk)
- These contain your actual running services

## ⚡ EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: **Execute Safe Deletions (IMMEDIATE)**
1. SSH into Proxmox: `ssh root@192.168.1.137`
2. Execute the Phase 1 commands above (April snapshots)
3. Monitor disk usage: `pvesm status local-lvm`
4. Execute Phase 2 commands (May snapshots)

### Step 2: **Monitor Results**
- Check storage usage after each phase
- Expected result: Significant space freed up
- Target: Reduce usage from 95.9% to <80%

### Step 3: **Long-term Prevention**
1. **Set up automatic snapshot cleanup**
2. **Implement storage monitoring**
3. **Create retention policies**

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **Never delete disk images** (`vm-XXX-disk-X`) - these are your actual VMs/containers
2. **Test snapshot deletion** with a few containers first
3. **Have backups** before major cleanup (your backup storage is also 99.9% full!)
4. **Monitor system** during cleanup

## 📊 Expected Outcome

**Before cleanup:** 334.51 GB / 348.82 GB (95.9% full)  
**After cleanup:** Estimated **30-50 GB freed** from snapshot deletion  
**Target usage:** ~85% (safe operating level)

---

**⚠️ REMEMBER:** This addresses the **immediate crisis** but you should also:
1. Clean up the backup storage (99.9% full)
2. Move some VMs to TrueNAS storage (abundant space)
3. Implement automated cleanup policies
