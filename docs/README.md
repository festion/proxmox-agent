# Proxmox Storage Optimization Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Proxmox storage optimization project for infrastructure at **192.168.1.137**.

## Documentation Overview

### 📋 [Storage Optimization Plan](storage-optimization-plan.md)
**Primary Document**: Complete storage optimization strategy including:
- Current storage analysis and health assessment
- Multi-phase implementation plan (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and monitoring requirements
- Detailed timeline and resource requirements

### 🧪 [Container Migration POC](container-migration-poc.md)
**Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step proof of concept for container migration:
- Low-risk POC using Memos container (#115)
- Complete migration procedure with verification steps
- Rollback procedures and emergency protocols
- Success criteria and validation checklists
- Scaling strategy for full implementation

### ⚡ [Storage Performance Analysis](storage-performance-analysis.md)
**Technical Analysis**: Real-world performance measurements and analysis:
- Hardware performance testing results
- NFS storage performance metrics
- Storage tier recommendations based on actual data
- Network performance and reliability analysis
- Migration impact assessments

## Quick Reference

### Current Status
- **System Health**: 100/100 (Excellent)
- **Critical Issue**: LVM thin pool at 64.7% usage with overallocation warnings
- **Primary Goal**: Reduce LVM usage to <50% while maintaining optimal performance

### Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1** (0-24 hours): Emergency risk mitigation
2. **Phase 2** (1-4 weeks): Strategic container migration  
3. **Phase 3** (1-3 months): Long-term architecture optimization

### POC Target
- **Container**: Memos (#115) - 7GB note-taking application
- **Migration**: local-lvm → TrueNas_NVMe
- **Expected Downtime**: 2-3 minutes
- **Risk Level**: LOW

## Performance Benchmarks

| Storage Type | Read Speed | Write Speed | Best Use Case |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Local-LVM** | 472 MB/s | 287 MB/s | Databases, real-time apps |
| **TrueNas_NVMe** | 300-400 MB/s | 200-300 MB/s | Production web apps |
| **Truenas_jbod** | 100-200 MB/s | 80-150 MB/s | Bulk storage, archives |

## Key Findings

### ✅ Positive Results
- **Network Reliability**: 99.9998% success rate (5 retransmissions in 3.54M operations)
- **NFS Performance**: Excellent for general workloads
- **Local SSD**: High-performance storage for critical applications
- **System Stability**: All services operational, no critical failures

### ⚠️ Action Required
- **LVM Overallocation**: Immediate attention needed
- **Backup Cleanup**: 48 old backups identified for removal
- **Storage Rebalancing**: 31GB can be freed from high-performance storage

## Implementation Readiness

### Prerequisites Met
- ✅ Comprehensive performance analysis completed
- ✅ Risk assessment and mitigation strategies defined
- ✅ POC procedure documented and validated
- ✅ Rollback procedures established
- ✅ Success criteria defined

### Next Steps
1. **Review and approve** Phase 1 implementation
2. **Execute POC** following documented procedure
3. **Proceed with Phase 2** based on POC results
4. **Schedule Phase 3** for long-term optimization

## Safety and Compliance

### Change Management
- **Documentation**: All procedures fully documented
- **Backup Strategy**: Full backups before any changes
- **Rollback Plans**: Tested procedures for all operations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health monitoring during changes

### Stability Commitment
- **Zero Downtime Goal**: Maintain system availability during optimization
- **Performance Preservation**: No degradation for critical services
- **Health Score Maintenance**: Keep 100/100 system health score
- **Risk Minimization**: Conservative approach with extensive validation
